apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: settings
  namespace: default
data:
  fieldOne: mismatch
  fieldTwo: |-
    Multi-line string
    This has a much larger difference with respect to the ConfigMap we're testing
    mismatch
    Multi-line string
    Oh yes, many more differences.  We shouldn't choose this one; choose the other one
